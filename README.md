# Alloy Python SDK

This SDK provides a Python interface for interacting with Alloy APIs. It's designed for ease of use and quick integration into Python projects.

## Installation

### Clone the repository

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/alloy_python.git
```

### Set up a virtual environment

Navigate to the cloned directory and create a virtual environment. This keeps dependencies required by this project separate from your global Python environment.

```bash
cd alloy_python
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- On macOS/Linux:
  ```bash
  source venv/bin/activate
  ```
- On Windows:
  ```bash
  venv\Scripts\activate
  ```

### Install dependencies and the package

Install the required dependencies and the SDK itself:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install .
```

## Usage

After installation, you can import and use the SDK in your Python projects:

```python
from alloy_python.embedded.app import App

# Example usage
app = App()
response = app.get_apps()
print(response)
```

Replace the example with relevant usage as per your application's requirements.
